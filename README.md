## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to my SQL practice repository!  

Here, I explore **complex data types** like arrays and JSON in PostgreSQL. These exercises helped me understand how to store, query, and manipulate structured and semi-structured data in a way that mirrors real-world applications.  

Whether you‚Äôre a fellow learner or just curious about SQL, this repo is for anyone who wants to level up their database skills.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Array Handling
- **Tables:** `master.students`, `master.section`

  - Using arrays for table relationships and joins
- **Example Queries:**
```sql
-- Get first semester marks
SELECT student_name, numbers[1] AS first_semester
FROM master.students;

-- Update array elements
UPDATE master.students
SET numbers[2] = 85
WHERE student_name = 'Jahid Hasan';```
